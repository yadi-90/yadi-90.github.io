        <p class="marginabout"> Hola! My name is Yadira Morales, and I'm originally from the beautiful city of Ensenada, Mexico, where the fish taco was invented. However, I currently reside in Utah with my husband and three kids, and I am pursuing a career in software engineering. Why? Because I am passionate about learning and willing to take risks to achieve my goals. I believe that pursuing a career in software engineering will challenge me to think outside of the box, and allow me to make a positive impact on the world.  </p>
        <p class="marginabout">One of the things that I love about problem-solving is the ability to look at the big picture. I thrive on the challenge of studying new or current systems, and finding the most efficient processes. I have had the opportunity to gain exposure in different roles and industries, which has allowed me to approach problems from different angles. From management roles to event planning, customer service, and even marketing, I have developed a diverse set of skills that have helped me to adapt to changes and move from one project to another with ease.</p>

          <p class="marginabout"> For example, when I worked in sales for a local Hispanic station in Salt Lake City, I had little experience and knowledge of the Hispanic buying power. However, I was determined to learn and grow in my role. One of my biggest accomplishments during my time there was planning the first Quinceanera Expo in Salt Lake City, which brought together over 500 people. I was able to coordinate with vendors to offer a free Quinceanera package to a lucky winner and bring in 30 vendors to the event, generating $15,000 in sales.</p>
          <p class="marginabout">My experiences have taught me the importance of perseverance and the value of taking risks. As a Hispanic woman, I am passionate about inspiring others, especially other Hispanic women, to pursue their goals. I want my work to make a difference in the world, whether it's through new discoveries or connections. I believe that by pursuing a career in software engineering, I can use my problem-solving skills to create meaningful change and inspire others to do the same.
